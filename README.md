# Random Bookmark

A small chrome extension that opens a random bookmark.

But why, you may ask? I find most of the music I listen to through YouTube, so I like to keep a bookmarks folder of all the songs I like. Sometimes I can't decide what I want to listen to, so that's where this extension comes in handy.

## Features

This extension is pretty minimal and includes only a few config options.

* Set the folder to pick a random bookmark from
* Toggle whether to include bookmarks in subfolders
* Set where bookmarks should be opened
